Over the last year, I have helped multiple teams refactor brittle notebooks into repeatable machine learning systems. The most impactful wins came from **aligning experimentation with deployment**.

## 1. Treat data contracts as code

Create schemas, drift checks, and volume monitors that run inside your orchestration layer. Whether you use Airflow, Prefect, or Dagster, promote every assumption about your data to a test.

## 2. Build once, deploy everywhere

Design your feature pipelines as Python packages. Export shared logic into `features/` modules, keep transformation functions pure, and reuse them across batch, streaming, and BI workloads.

## 3. Automate evaluation

Add regression suites that compare new model metrics with the previous champion. Emit alerts to Slack or email when KPIs fall outside guardrails, and grab a quick SHAP summary to explain the change.

When you are ready to implement a similar workflow, reach out. I love helping data teams modernize their stack.
